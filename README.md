### üìå **Project Description**

This Java project is a **console-based Weather Application** that allows users to:

1. **Fetch real-time weather data** from the OpenWeatherMap API
2. **Display important weather information** such as:

   * City Name
   * Weather Condition
   * Temperature
   * Humidity
   * Atmospheric Pressure

It demonstrates the usage of:

* **HTTP connections** using `HttpURLConnection`
* **API interaction** with OpenWeatherMap
* **JSON parsing** using the `org.json` library
* **Exception handling** to manage network and data errors

The city name can be dynamically set, and the weather data is retrieved in **metric units (¬∞C)**.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

* Java (JDK 8 or higher)
* OpenWeatherMap API
* JSON Parsing with `org.json.JSONObject`

### üì• **How It Works**

1. The `getWeatherData(String cityName)` method constructs a URL with the API key and the city name.
2. A GET request is sent to OpenWeatherMap.
3. JSON response is parsed to extract the weather details.
4. The details are printed to the console in a well-structured format.
